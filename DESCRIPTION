Description: BRPL is an R package that provides methods for identifying subgroups within populations based on their individual response patterns to a specific intervention or treatment. It enables researchers and clinicians to investigate heterogeneous treatment effects and develop personalized therapy approaches, offering functions to analyze and visualize the interplay between two variables, aiding in the understanding of social sustainability metrics. The overall goal of BRPL is to provide tools for bivariate discriminant analysis, focusing on the relationship between variable indicators.
